<p>I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu">Department of Statistics & Applied Probability</a> at the <a href="https://ucsb.edu">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>, and a faculty scientist in <a href="https://crd.lbl.gov/departments/data-science-and-technology/data-analytics-and-visualization">Computational Research Division</a> at <a href="https://www.lbl.gov">Lawrence Berkeley Lab</a>. My CV can be found <a href="/assets/files/CV.pdf">here</a></p>

<p>My research interests include learning underlying relationships in large scale data. I work on topics in inference, scalable computation, and high-performance software implementation for graphical models, and I enjoy applying my research to genomic, financial, and neuroscience data.</p>

<p>My office is at South Hall, Room 5514 (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/92n9iTrecfB91McQ8">Google Map</a>).</p>
